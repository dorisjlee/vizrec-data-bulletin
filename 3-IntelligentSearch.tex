\section{Vague Intelligent Search\label{sec:vague}}
Accounting for user interaction, mental models. More global objective taking into account user with the goal of dataset understanding rather than task completion.
\subsection{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item Inferring user intent in querying and context is important (both in terms of user input and what is recommended)
\item tools can not assume user has querying intention. exploration without intention, user donâ€™t know what they are searching for --> Recommendation.
\item The important thing here is identifying what should be done by the system v.s. requested from user. Inappropriate choice of these will result in lack of expressibility and user feeling lack of control of analysis, limiting exploration.
\item Need for a unified framework of inference to take all of these into account (e.g. natural language, etc)
\end{itemize}
