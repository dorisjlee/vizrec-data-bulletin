\section{Concluding Remarks\label{sec:conclusion}}

% Data is agnostic to the user, intention ---, by building tools---, Section \ref{sec:precise} to \ref{sec:vague} have focussed on extracting what user want from data. bridging together what user want from data, what data has to offer, supporting interactive discourse between the two. 
%  Either using one-size-fits-all statistics, templates, heuristics as a solution or problem only applicable to a subset of analytic tasks\cite{Vartak2015,Vartak2017}. 

In this paper, we advocate supporting a desiderata consisting of  3`I's in the cycle of visual data exploration:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Informative}: Section~\ref{sec:precise} discusses how precise visual query systems provide informative visualizations to accelerate the process of data discovery. 
	\item \textbf{Interactive and iterative}: Section~\ref{sec:vague}
	Joining the flow, query refinement, dialogue (not a one-shot query), feedback and recommendation, expressivity (how easy is it to express what to do via interactions) and diversity of actions that could be performed.
	\item \textbf{Integrated}: Section \ref{sec:understanding} discusses the challenges and opportunities in moving from intention-driven querying to facilitating more integrated data understanding and awareness during the analysis workflow.
\end{itemize}
