\section{Concluding Remarks\label{sec:conclusion}}
\par Data is inherently agnostic to the diverse information needs any user may have. Visual data exploration systems help bridge the gap between what users want to get from the data through querying and what insights the data has to offer through recommendations. To more facilitate a more productive collaboration, in this paper, we discuss how precise visual query systems provide informative visualizations to accelerate the process of data discovery, how intelligent visual query systems account for vague and complex query through query refinement feedback, and how recommendations could promote better distributional and contextual awareness for users. We hope that the agenda sketched out in this paper sheds light to the many more exciting research questions and opportunities to come in this nascent growing field.% and encourage database researchers to ----- tackle in this space.
% This paper discusses how to better support these and how ----. Section~\ref{sec:precise} discusses how precise visual query systems provide informative visualizations to accelerate the process of data discovery. Section~\ref{sec:vague} discusses mixed-intiative systems that accounts for vague and complex query and allow users to provide feedback to refine their queries. Section \ref{sec:understanding} discusses the challenges and opportunities in moving from intention-driven querying to facilitating more integrated data understanding and awareness during the analysis workflow.

% Data is agnostic to the user, intention ---, by building tools---, Section \ref{sec:precise} to \ref{sec:vague} have focussed on extracting what user want from data. bridging together what user want from data, what data has to offer, supporting interactive discourse between the two. 

% \par In this paper, we advocate supporting a desiderata consisting of  3`I's in the cycle of visual data exploration:

% 	\item \textbf{Informative}: Section~\ref{sec:precise} discusses how precise visual query systems provide informative visualizations to accelerate the process of data discovery. 
% 	\item \textbf{Iterative}: Section~\ref{sec:vague} discusses mixed-intiative systems that accounts for vague and complex query and allow users to provide feedback to refine their

% 	\item \textbf{Integrated}: Section \ref{sec:understanding} discusses the challenges and opportunities in moving from intention-driven querying to facilitating more integrated data understanding and awareness during the analysis workflow.
