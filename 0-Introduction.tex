\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Visual analysis help discover insights, etc. But finding the right vis and relevant data is hard, 
	\item  we discuss \zv as one use case and solution in this space (Section \ref{sec:precise})
	\item During our PD + others, hypothesis + in the loop considerations is important. We discuss relevant work and our findings in Section \ref{sec:hypothesis}
	\item Users might not always have something they want to start with, supporting vague querying (Section~\ref{sec:vague})
	\item  One aspect of this is to gain understanding of dataset, (e.g. representative and outliers in \zv, bottom up exploration)we discuss \sbd as one example solution addressing this problem (Section \ref{sec:understanding}).
