Intention driven task-based querying (Precise search)
\subsection{Challenges}
Thereâ€™s a large space of possibilities, manual search is tedious. Either using one-size-fits-all statistics, templates, heuristics as a solution or problem only applicable to a subset of analytic tasks\cite{Vartak2015,Vartak2017}. Propose VQS as a solution\cite{Lee2017}. Iterate over collections of visualizations \cite{Siddiqui}
\subsubsection{Usage Scenario}
\subsection{Effortless Data Exploration with \zv}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ZQL offers a way to iterate over collections of visualizations\cite{Wongsuphasawat2016}
	\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges Ahead}
The goal here is to help novice submit precise queries without SQL background, easy to use interface. Our study found that VQS does more than just this, but still not enough.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Precise Search Fail to understand intricacies of user need/intent, need more expressivity/flexibility for querying.
	\item  No perfect training workload, real-world data + task is noisy and complex. 
	\item towards more holistic model for insight discovery
\end{itemize}
