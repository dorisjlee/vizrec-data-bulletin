\section{Towards Dataset Understanding\label{sec:understanding}}
\subsection{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item Problem of cold-start recommendation (as discussed earlier use may not always know what to query for)
\item related works have focussed on making specification easier , but not really trying to understnad user intent or what might the user want to see.
\item Within a dataset, structure and provenance is essential to help users navigate and provide users with sense of coverage and completion. This is an important but underexplored area. (viz-sum, Sarvghad et al 2017)
\item schema and attribute understanding (coverage, etc) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
	\item understanding distributions (distribution awareness)
	\item providing overview recommendations (representative trends and outliers)
\end{itemize}
