abstract = {Data analysis involves constantly formulating and testing new hypotheses and questions about data. When dealing with a new dataset, especially one with many dimensions, it can be cumbersome for the analyst to clearly remember which aspects of the data have been investigated (i.e., visually examined for patterns, trends, outliers etc.) and which combinations have not. Yet this information is critical to help the analyst formulate new questions that they have not already answered. We observe that for tabular data, questions are typically comprised of varying combinations of data dimensions (e.g., what are the trends of Sales and Profit for different Regions?). We propose representing analysis history from the angle of dimension coverage (i.e., which data dimensions have been investigated and in which combinations). We use scented widgets [30] to incorporate dimension coverage of the analysts' past work into interaction widgets of a visualization tool. We demonstrate how this approach can assist analysts with the question formation process. Our approach extends the concept of scented widgets to reveal aspects of one's own analysis history, and offers a different perspective on one's past work than typical visualization history tools. Results of our empirical study showed that participants with access to embedded dimension coverage information relied on this information when formulating questions, asked more questions about the data, generated more top-level findings, and showed greater breadth of their analysis without sacrificing depth.},

The so-called Internet of Things (IoT) represents the integration of several computing and communications systems aiming at facilitating the interaction between these devices. Arduino is one of the most popular platforms used to prototype new IoT devices due to its open, flexible and easy-to-use archi- tecture. Ardunio Yun is a dual board microcontroller that supports a Linux distribution and it is currently one of the most versatile and powerful Arduino systems. This feature positions Arduino Yun as a popular platform for developers, but it also introduces unique infection vectors from the secu- rity viewpoint. In this work, we present a security analysis of Arduino Yun. We show that Arduino Yun is vulnerable to a number of attacks and we implement a proof of concept capable of exploiting some of them.},

abstract = {Database users commonly explore large data sets by running ag-gregate queries that project the data down to a smaller number of points and dimensions, and visualizing the results. Often, such vi-sualizations will reveal outliers that correspond to errors or surpris-ing features of the input data set. Unfortunately, databases and vi-sualization systems do not provide a way to work backwards from an outlier point to the common properties of the (possibly many) unaggregated input tuples that correspond to that outlier. We pro-pose Scorpion, a system that takes a set of user-specified outlier points in an aggregate query result as input and finds predicates that explain the outliers in terms of properties of the input tuples that are used to compute the selected outlier results. Specifically, this explanation identifies predicates that, when applied to the in-put data, cause the outliers to disappear from the output. To find such predicates, we develop a notion of influence of a predicate on a given output, and design several algorithms that efficiently search for maximum influence predicates over the input data. We show that these algorithms can quickly find outliers in two real data sets (from a sensor deployment and a campaign finance data set), and run orders of magnitude faster than a naive search algorithm while providing comparable quality on a synthetic data set.},

@article{Heer2012,
abstract = {The increasing scale and availability of digital data provides an extraordinary resource for informing public policy, scientific discovery, business strategy, and even our personal lives. To get the most out of such data, however, users must be able to make sense of it: to pursue questions, uncover patterns of interest, and identify (and potentially correct) errors. In concert with data-management systems and statistical algorithms, analysis requires contextualized human judgments regarding the domain-specific significance of the clusters, trends, and outliers discovered in data. Visualization provides a powerful means of making sense of data. By mapping data attributes to visual properties such as position, size, shape, and color, visualization designers leverage perceptual skills to help users discern and interpret patterns within data.11 A single image, however, typically provides answers to, at best, a handful of questions. Instead, visual analysis typically progresses in an iterative process of view creation, exploration, and refinement. Meaningful analysis consists of repeated explorations as users develop insights about significant relationships, domain-specific contextual influences, and causal patterns. Confusing widgets, complex dialog boxes, hidden operations, incomprehensible displays, or slow response times can limit the range and depth of topics considered and may curtail thorough deliberation and introduce errors. To be most effective, visual analytics tools must support the fluent and flexible use of visualizations at rates resonant with the pace of human thought. The goal of this article is to assist designers, researchers, professional analysts, procurement officers, educators, and students in evaluating and creating visual analysis tools. We present a taxonomy of interactive dynamics that contribute to successful analytic dialogues. The taxonomy consists of 12 task types grouped into three high-level categories, as shown in table 1: (1) data and view specification (visualize, filter, sort, and derive); (2) view manipulation (select, navigate, coordinate, and organize); and (3) analysis process and provenance (record, annotate, share, and guide). These categories incorporate the critical tasks that enable iterative visual analysis, including visualization creation, interactive querying, multiview coordination, history, and collaboration. Validating and evolving this taxonomy is a community project that proceeds through feedback, critique, and refinement. Our focus on interactive elements presumes a basic familiarity with visualization design. The merits and frailties of bar charts, scatter plots, timelines, and node-link diagrams, and of the visual-encoding decisions that underlie such graphics, are certainly a central concern, but we will largely pass over them here. A number of articles and books address these topics in great detail,11,12,16,52 and we recommend them to interested readers. Within each branch of the taxonomy presented here, we describe example systems that exhibit useful interaction techniques. To be clear, these examples do not constitute an exhaustive survey; rather, each is intended to convey the nature and diversity of interactive operations. Throughout the article the term analyst refers to someone who uses visual analysis tools and not to a specific person or role. Our notion of analyst encompasses anyone seeking to understand data: traditional analysts investigating financial markets or terrorist networks, scientists uncovering new insights, journalists piecing together a story, and people tracking various facets of their lives, including blood pressure, money spent, electricity used, or miles traveled.},

abstract = {Writing complex queries in SQL is a challenge for users. Prior work has developed several techniques to ease query specification but none of these techniques are applicable to a particularly difficult class of queries: quantified queries. Our hypothesis is that users prefer to specify quantified queries interactively by trial-and-error. We identify two impediments to this form of interactive trial-and-error query specification in SQL: (i) changing quantifiers often requires global syntactical query restructuring, and (ii) the absence of non-answers from SQL's results makes verifying query correctness difficult. We remedy these issues with DataPlay, a query tool with an underlying graphical query language, a unique data model and a graphical interface. DataPlay provides two interaction features that support trial-and-error query specification. First, DataPlay allows users to directly manipulate a graphical query by changing quantifiers and modifying dependencies between constraints. Users receive real-time feedback in the form of updated answers and non-answers. Second, DataPlay can auto-correct a user's query, based on user feedback about which tuples to keep or drop from the answers and non-answers. We evaluated the effectiveness of each interaction feature with a user study and we found that direct query manipulation is more effective than auto-correction for simple queries but auto-correction is more effective than direct query manipulation for more complex queries.},

The system sets 'large' to be of magnitude 5 and greater, while 'near' is a 100 mile radius around the border of California. Two ambiguity widgets are added to the interface to allow the user to modify these settings. ABSTRACT Natural language interfaces for visualizations have emerged as a promising new way of interacting with data and performing ana-lytics. Many of these systems have fundamental limitations. Most return minimally interactive visualizations in response to queries and often require experts to perform modeling for a set of predicted user queries before the systems are effective. Eviza provides a natural language interface for an interactive query dialog with an existing visualization rather than starting from a blank sheet and ask-ing closed-ended questions that return a single text answer or static visualization. The system employs a probabilistic grammar based approach with predefined rules that are dynamically updated based on the data from the visualization, as opposed to computationally intensive deep learning or knowledge based approaches. The result of an interaction is a change to the view (e.g., filtering, navigation, selection) providing graphical answers and ambiguity widgets to handle ambiguous queries and system defaults. There is also rich domain awareness of time, space, and quantitative reason-ing built in, and linking into existing knowledge bases for additional semantics. Eviza also supports pragmatics and exploring multi-modal interactions to help enhance the expressiveness of how users can ask questions about their data during the flow of visual analysis.},

@article{Hoque2017,
abstract = {Interactive visual data analysis is most productive when users can focus on answering the questions they have about their data, rather than focusing on how to operate the interface to the analysis tool. One viable approach to engaging users in interactive conversations with their data is a natural language interface to visualizations. These interfaces have the potential to be both more expressive and more accessible than other interaction paradigms. We explore how principles from language pragmatics can be applied to the flow of visual analytical conversations, using natural language as an input modality. We evaluate the effectiveness of pragmatics support in our system Evizeon, and present design considerations for conversation interfaces to visual analytics tools.},

@article{Gao2015,
abstract = {Answering questions with data is a difficult and time-consuming process. Visual dashboards and templates make it easy to get started, but asking more sophisticated questions often requires learning a tool designed for expert analysts. Natural language interaction allows users to ask questions directly in complex programs without having to learn how to use an interface. However, natural language is often ambiguous. In this work we propose a mixed-initiative approach to managing ambiguity in natural language interfaces for data visualization. We model ambiguity throughout the process of turning a natural language query into a visualization and use algorithmic disambiguation coupled with interactive ambiguity widgets. These widgets allow the user to resolve ambiguities by surfacing system decisions at the point where the ambiguity matters. Corrections are stored as constraints and influence subsequent queries. We have implemented these ideas in a system, DataTone. In a comparative study, we find that DataTone is easy to learn and lets users ask questions without worrying about syntax and proper question form.},

@article{Fast2018,
abstract = {Today's conversational agents are restricted to simple standalone commands. In this paper, we present Iris, an agent that draws on human conversational strategies to combine commands, allowing it to perform more complex tasks that it has not been explicitly designed to support: for example, composing one command to "plot a histogram" with another to first "log-transform the data". To enable this complexity, we introduce a domain specific language that transforms commands into automata that Iris can compose, sequence, and execute dynamically by interacting with a user through natural language, as well as a conversational type system that manages what kinds of commands can be combined. We have designed Iris to help users with data science tasks, a domain that requires support for command combination. In evaluation, we find that data scientists complete a predictive modeling task significantly faster (2.6 times speedup) with Iris than a modern non-conversational programming environment. Iris supports the same kinds of commands as today's agents, but empowers users to weave together these commands to accomplish complex goals.},
