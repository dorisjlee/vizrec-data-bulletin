\section{Hypothesis Formation}
\subsection{Supporting cycle of visual analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Essential ingredient in facillitating intelligent vague querying and exploration.
	\item This is a human process (cite \cite{Heer2012},\cite{Pirolli})
	\item Iterative Hypothesis Exploration/Refinement : argue that the following properties is important to sustain this “cycle of visual analysis” 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Towards 3‘I’s of rapid hypothesis generation support}
Towards 3‘I’s Interactive, Iterative, Informative
Interactive (how natural is it to move between analysis steps, facilitate fluid analysis and not get “stuck”) : interactivity, feedback (latter is quite unexplored), and recommendation, expressivity (how easy is it to express what to do via interactions) and diversity of actions that could be performed.
Iterative: query refinement, dialogue (not a one-shot query)
Informative: not just task-based interestingness but more explanation based (causality, introduce distribution awareness notion in viz-sum)
